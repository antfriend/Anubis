# USB-C 2S LiPo / 2x18650 Power Board Design

## Goal

Small KiCad board that accepts 5 V from USB-C, charges a 2S Li-ion/LiPo pack, and generates switched 5 V and 3.3 V rails for external devices controlled by the Hosyond ESP32-S3 display board.

The battery source is now selectable by population/use:

- External 2S LiPo pack through `J7`, a 3-pin JST-XH style balance connector: `B-`, `CELL_MID`, `B+`.
- Two installed 18650 cells in series through `BT1` and `BT2`.

Use either the external 2S pack on `J7` or installed 18650 cells, not both at the same time.

## Battery Nets

- `BATT_RAW_N`: raw 2S pack negative / lower cell negative before the current-sense resistor.
- `GND`: protected board/load/charger negative after the current-sense resistor.
- `CELL_MID`: lower cell positive and upper cell negative.
- `BATT_RAW_P`: raw upper-cell positive / raw 2S pack positive.
- `FET_MID_COMMON`: common **drain** node between the high-side charge/discharge FETs (r17; replaces the r16 `FET_SRC_COMMON` common-source node).
- `FET_BATT_P`: raw-cell-side node after `F4`; the **source** of the high-side charge FET.
- `BAT_SYS`: protected 2S system/charger positive bus feeding the charger BAT/SNS pins and both buck regulators.

The two 18650 holders are now series-connected:

- `BT1`: lower cell, negative to `BATT_RAW_N`, positive through `F2` to `CELL_MID`.
- `BT2`: upper cell, negative to `CELL_MID`, positive through `F3` to `BATT_RAW_P`.
- `J7`: external 2S balance input, pin 1 `BATT_RAW_N`, pin 2 `CELL_MID`, pin 3 `BATT_RAW_P`.

## 2S Protection

The old single-cell `BQ297xy` protection IC is not valid for a 2S pack, and the ABLIC `S-8252AAH-M6T1U` was replaced because the available purchasing terms were not practical for prototypes. The active schematic now uses TI `BQ28Z610DRZR-R1`, which combines 1S/2S fuel gauging, programmable protection, I2C communication, current sensing, and external charge/discharge FET control.

R14 BQ28Z610 support parts:

- `R14`, `R15`: 470 ohm cell-sense input resistors for `VC2` and `VC1`.
- `C25`, `C26`: 100 nF cell-sense filter capacitors.
- `R16`: 100 ohm `PACK` input series resistor from `BAT_SYS` to `BQ_PACK`.
- `C30`: 2.2 uF `PBI` hold-up capacitor to `BATT_RAW_N`.
- `R46`: 2 milliohm current-sense resistor in series between `BATT_RAW_N` and protected `GND`; Kelvin route both ends.
- `R47`, `R48`, `C31`: 100 ohm / 100 nF `SRN`/`SRP` differential input filter. `SRP` now Kelvin-senses the raw-cell-negative side of `R46`; `SRN` senses the protected/system-ground side.
- `R21`, `R22`: 100 ohm gate-drive series resistors from `BQ_DSG` and `BQ_CHG`.
- `Q1`: `CSD18502Q5B` high-side charge FET, source pins 1-3 on `FET_BATT_P`, gate pin 4 on `CO_GATE`, and drain pins 5-8 plus the main drain island on `FET_MID_COMMON`.
- `Q2`: `CSD18502Q5B` high-side discharge FET, source pins 1-3 on `BAT_SYS`, gate pin 4 on `DO_GATE`, and drain pins 5-8 plus the main drain island on `FET_MID_COMMON`.
- `R49`, `R50`: 10 Mohm gate-source bleed resistors, each returning to its own FET's source: `R50` `CO_GATE` to `FET_BATT_P`, `R49` `DO_GATE` to `BAT_SYS`.
- `C32`, `C33`: 100 nF capacitors across the high-side FETs for ESD/transient handling per TI layout guidance.
- `F4`: high-side battery path fuse between `FET_BATT_P` and `BATT_RAW_P`.

R14 release note: the previous low-side dual-FET topology was removed because it was incompatible with the BQ28Z610 high-side gate driver. R14 keeps the corrected high-side topology and swaps Q1/Q2 to JLC-available `CSD18502Q5B` FETs using the project-local TI DNK/VSON-CLIP footprint. The charger `BAT/SNS` pins and the buck-regulator input bus are on `BAT_SYS`, so charge and discharge current pass through the high-side protection FETs and through `R46`.

R17 release note (corrects a fault found on the fabricated r16 board): r14 through r16 wired Q1/Q2 **common-source**, with the shared node floating between the two FETs. That is wrong for the BQ28Z610. The device's two gate outputs are referenced to two *different* nodes -- SLUSAS3D 8.3.13: when drive is disabled "an internal circuit discharges `CHG` to `VC2` and `DSG` to `PACK`" -- so the two FETs must have two different sources, which forces a **common-drain** pair with each source facing its own outer terminal. With the r16 common-source wiring the shared node was undriven (both body diodes point outward from it), so off-state Vgs was undefined and the protection FETs were never properly commanded. r17 re-orients the pair:

```
FET_BATT_P --[Q1 S..D]-- FET_MID_COMMON --[Q2 D..S]-- BAT_SYS
(raw cells, post-F4)     (common drain)              (protected system = U2 PACK sense)
```

Each gate bleed now returns to its own FET's source, so both FETs have a defined off state. Two further r16 field faults are corrected in the same spin: `D2`/`D3` had the anode on pad 1, but KiCad's `LED_0603_1608Metric` pad 1 is the **cathode**, so both status LEDs were reverse-biased; and `J7` moves from the front edge to the rear edge (rotated 180 deg), which reverses its pin order along X and corrects the reversed battery polarity. `J7`'s netlist pin assignment is deliberately unchanged -- swapping the pin 1 / pin 3 nets as well would reintroduce the fault.

The protector does not set the normal charge current. The BQ25887 charger should be configured so USB-C charging is firmware-limited from 500 mA minimum up to 1.5 A maximum, with the hardware input-current limit also held at or below 1.5 A.

## Regulator Population

The 1S boost/buck-boost regulators were replaced because a 2S pack ranges roughly from discharged to 8.4 V full charge.

- `U3`: `AP63200WU` configured for 5 V with `R8 = 523 kOhm` and `R9 = 100 kOhm`.
- `U4`: `AP63200WU` configured for 3.3 V with `R11 = 316 kOhm` and `R12 = 100 kOhm`.
- `L1` and `L2`: 4.7 uH shielded inductors.
- Input capacitors on `BAT_SYS` are rated 16 V.
- Output capacitors are rated at least 10 V.

## Switched Outputs And Signals

- `SW1` Pololu #2808: `+5V` in, `+5V_SW` out, control through `CTRL_5V_SW` from ESP32 `GPIO2`.
- `SW2` Pololu #2808: `+3V3` in, `+3V3_SW` out, control through `CTRL_3V3_SW` from ESP32 `GPIO3`.
- `J4`: 5-pin 1.25 mm JST UART header with `+5V_SW`, GND, TX, RX, GND.
- `J5`: 4-pin 2.54 mm I2C header with `+3V3_SW`, GND, SDA, SCL.
- `J6`: 2-pin deep-sleep pushbutton header between `GPIO14` and `GPIO21`.
- `J3x`: individual solder pads for the Hosyond board wires.

## MCP23017 GPIO Expander

The daughterboard now includes `U7`, a Microchip `MCP23017-E/SO` 16-bit I2C GPIO expander in SOIC-28W.

- `VDD`: `+3V3_SW`, so the expander shuts down with the switched 3.3 V rail.
- `VSS`: protected `GND`.
- `SDA` / `SCL`: shared `I2C_SDA` / `I2C_SCL` bus with the ADS1115s.
- Address pins `A0`, `A1`, and `A2`: default 0 ohm straps to GND, giving address `0x20`.
- `RESET`: 10 kOhm pullup to `+3V3_SW` and 100 nF reset capacitor to GND.
- `INTA` / `INTB`: 10 kOhm pullups to `+3V3_SW` and individual solder pads.
- GPIO outputs: `GPA0..GPA7` and `GPB0..GPB7` each pass through a 100 ohm series resistor to an individual solder pad.
- ESD placeholders: four 4-channel 3.3 V TVS/ESD arrays protect the external pad side of the 16 GPIO lines.
- `GPA7` and `GPB7`: treat as output-only unless the exact MCP23017 variant/revision is verified for input use.

Because the MCP23017 is powered from `+3V3_SW`, firmware should enable the 3.3 V switched rail before using the I2C bus for the expander. The ADS1115 pullups are also on `+3V3_SW`, so the switched 3.3 V rail is the intended I2C pullup source for the daughterboard devices.

## Generated Files

- `Daughterboard.kicad_sch`: generated pin-level schematic.
- `Daughterboard.kicad_sym`: project-local symbols.
- `Daughterboard_pinlevel_bom.csv`: generated BOM with purchase-link column.
- `Daughterboard_pcb_bom.csv`, `pcb_component_schedule.csv`, `starter_bom_and_nets.csv`, and `starter_bom_and_nets_with_links.csv`: synced BOM copies.
- `Daughterboard_pinlevel.pdf` and `Daughterboard_pinlevel_preview.png`: exported schematic preview.
- `Daughterboard_pinlevel_erc.rpt`: KiCad ERC report.

## Footprint Policy

The design is space-constrained, so rev-A uses SMD footprints for nearly all normal components:

- Fuses/PTCs: 1206 SMD fuse footprints.
- NTC: 0603 SMD thermistor footprint.
- Buck/charger inductors: compact shielded SMD inductor footprints.
- Resistors/capacitors: 0603/0805 SMD as listed in the BOM.
- Hosyond and MCP23017 wire breakouts: flat 1.5 mm SMD test pads.
- ICs, ESD arrays, FETs, charger, regulators, ADCs, and MCP23017: SMD packages.

The intentional exceptions are mechanical/interface parts: USB-C, 18650 holders, Pololu switch modules, JST connectors, and 2.54 mm pin headers. Those connector styles were left unchanged.
